Lingua::JA::FindDates - scan text to find dates in a Japanese format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("synopsis") %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an aid for translating documents in Japanese. This module's
main routine, L</subsjdate>, scans a text and finds things which
appear to be Japanese dates.

The module recognizes a variety of date formats. It recognizes the
typical format of dates with the year first, followed by the month,
then the day, such as 平成20年七月十日 I<(Heisei nijūnen shichigatsu
tōka)>. It also recognizes combinations such as years alone, years and
months, a month and day without a year, fiscal years (年度, I<nendo>),
parts of the month, like 中旬 (I<chūjun>, the middle of the month),
and periods between two dates.

The module recognizes both Japanese years, such as "平成２４年"
(Heisei), and European years, such as 2012年. It recognizes ASCII
numerals, 1, 2, 3; the "wide" or "double width" numerals sometimes
used in Japan, １, ２, ３ (see
L<What is "wide ASCII"?|http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/wide-ascii.html>); 
and the kanji-based numeral system, 一, 二,三. It recognizes some
special date formats such as 元年 for the first year of an era. It
recognizes era names identified by their initial letters, such as S41
年 for Shōwa 41 (1966). It recognizes dates regardless of spacing
between characters, such as "平 成 二 十 年 八 月".

The input text must be marked as Unicode, in other words character
data, not byte data.

The module has been tested on several hundreds of documents, and it
should cope with all common Japanese dates. If you find that it cannot
identify some kind of date within Japanese text, please report a bug.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 subsjdate

    my $translation = subsjdate ($text);

Translate Japanese dates into American dates. The first argument to
C<subsjdate> is a string like "平成２０年７月３日（木）". The routine
looks through the string to see if there is anything which appears to
be a Japanese date. If it finds one, it makes an equivalent date in
English, and then substitutes it into C<$text>, as if performing the
following type of operation:

    $text =~ s/平成２０年７月３日（木）/Thursday, July 3, 2008/g;

If the text contains the interval between two dates, C<subsjdate>
attempts to convert that into an English-language interval.


The default dates are American-style, with the month first. Users can
supply a different date-making function using the second argument:

    my $translation = subsjdate ($text, {make_date => \mymakedate,
                                 make_date_interval => \myinterval});

The second argument is a hash reference which may have the
following members:

=over

=item replace

    subsjdate ($text, {replace => \&my_replace, data => $my_data});
    # Now "my_replace" is called as
    # my_replace ($my_data, $before, $after);

If a code reference is supplied as C<replace>, subsjdate calls it as a
subroutine with user-defined data L</data>, and C<$before>, the
matched date and C<$after> the string with which it is to be replaced.

If C<replace> is not supplied, subsjdate substitutes the dates itself.

=item data

Any data you want to pass to L</replace>, above. If nothing is
supplied, C<subsjdate> simply passes the undefined value.

=item make_date

    subsjdate ($text, {make_date => \& mymakedate});

This is a replacement for the default L</default_make_date>
function. The default function turns "平成10年11月12日" into "November
12, 1998". To change this to dates in the form "Th 2008/7/3", use a
routine like the following:

[% example("subsjdate-make-date") %]

The first two arguments passed to the user-defined routine are
C<$data>, user-defined data as described in L</data>, and
C<$original>, the original Japanese-language date. The following
argument is the date as a hash reference, with the fields C<year>
(Western-style year), C<month> (1-12), C<date> (1-31), and C<wday>
(1-7 for Monday to Sunday). Your routine must check whether the fields
C<year>, C<month>, C<date>, and C<wday> are defined, since
L</subsjdate> matches all kinds of dates including year only,
month/day only, and year/month only dates.

=item make_date_interval

This is a replacement for the L</default_make_date_interval> function. 

    subsjdate ($text, {make_date_interval => \&mymakedateinterval});

Your routine is called in the same way as the default routine,
L</default_make_date_interval>. Its arguments are C<$data> and
C<$original> as for C<make_date>, and the two dates in the form of
hash references with the same keys as for C<make_date>.

=head2 kanji2number

    kanji2number ($knum)

C<kanji2number> is a simple kanji number convertor for use with
dates. Its input is one string of kanji numbers only, like '三十一'.
It can deal with kanji numbers with or without ten/hundred/thousand
kanjis. The return value is the numerical value of the kanji number,
like 31, or zero if it can't read the number.

kanji2number only goes up to thousands, because usually dates only go
that far. For a more comprehensive Japanese number convertor, see
L<Lingua::JA::Numbers>.

=head2 seireki_to_nengo

[% example("seireki-to-nengo") %]

This function substitutes Western-style dates with Japanese-style
"nengo" dates (年号). The "nengo" dates go back to the Meiji period
(1868). See L</BUGS>.

=head2 nengo_to_seireki

[% example("nengo-to-seireki") %]

This function substitutes Japanese-style "nengo" dates (年号) with
Western-style dates. The "nengo" dates go back to the Meiji period
(1868). See L</BUGS>.

=head2 regjnums

    my $number = regjnums ($number);

This is a simplistic number regularizer which utilizes
L</kanji2number> to convert kanji digits or wide ascii numerals into
Arabic numeral equivalents. Like L</kanji2number>, it can only cope
with kanji numbers up to 9,999. Please see L</Lingua::JA::Numbers> for
a fuller system.

=head1 DEFAULT CALLBACKS

This section discusses the default subroutines which are called as
dates are found to convert the Japanese dates into another string
format. These callbacks are not exported. In versions of this module
prior to 0.022, these functions were called C<make_date> and
C<make_date_interval> respectively. The previous names still work.

=head2 default_make_date

L</subsjdate>, given a date like 平成２０年７月３日（木） (Heisei year
20, month 7, day 3, in other words "Thursday the third of July,
2008"), passes C<make_date> a hash reference with values C<< year =>
2008, month => 7, date => 3, wday => 4 >> for the year, month, date
and day of the week. C<make_date> turns the date information supplied
to it into a string representing the date. C<make_date> is not
exported.

Here is an example of how it operates:

[% example("make-date") %]

To replace the default routine C<make_date> with a different format,
supply a C<make_date> callback to L</subsjdate>:

[% example("my-date") %]

Note that, depending on what dates are in your document, some of the
hash values may not be available, so the user routine needs to handle
the cases when the year or the month or the day of the month are
missing.

=head2 default_make_date_interval

[% example("default-make-date-interval") %]

This function is called when an interval of two dates, such as 平成３年
７月２日〜９日, is detected. It makes a string to represent that
interval in English. It takes two arguments, hash references to the
first and second date. The hash references are in the same format as
L</default_make_date>.

This function is not exported. It is the default used by
L</subsjdate>. You can use another function instead of this default by
supplying a value C<make_date_interval> as a callback in L</subsjdate>.

=head1 BUGS

The following special cases are not covered.

=over

=item Doesn't do 元日 (I<ganjitsu>)

This date (another way to write "1st January") is a little difficult,
since the characters which make it up could also occur in other
contexts, like 元日本軍 I<gennihongun>, "the former Japanese
military". Correctly parsing it requires a linguistic analysis of the
text, which this module isn't able to do.

=item １０月第４月曜日

"１０月第４月曜日", which means "the fourth Monday of October", comes
out as "October第April曜日".

=item 今年６月

The module does not handle things like 今年 (this year), 去年 (last
year), or 来年 (next year).

=item 末日

The module does not handle "末日" (matsujitsu) "the last day" (of a month).

=item 土日祝日

The module does not handle "土日祝日" (weekends and holidays).

=item 年末年始

The module does not handle "年末年始" (the new year period).

=back

Please also note the following:

=over

=item Minimal sanity check of Japanese era dates

It does not detect that dates like 昭和99年 (Showa 99, an impossible
year, since Showa 63 (1988) was succeeded by Heisei 1 (1989)) are
invalid. It does, however, only allow two digits for these named-era
dates.

=item Only goes back to Meiji

The date matching only goes back to the Meiji era. There is
L<DateTime::Calendar::Japanese::Era> if you need to go back further.

=item Doesn't find dates in order

For those supplying their own callback routines, note that the dates
returned won't be in the order that they are in the text, but in the
order that they are found by the regular expressions, which means that
in a string with two dates, the callbacks might be called for the
second date before they are called for the first one. Dates which
contain more information, such as a month, day and year, are searched
for before shorter ones, such as a year only or a month and day only.

=item UTF-8 version only

This module only understands Japanese encoded in Perl's internal form
(UTF-8).

=item Trips a bug in Perl 5.10

If you send subsjdate a string which is pure ASCII, you'll get a
stream of warning messages about "uninitialized value". The error
messages are wrong - this is actually a bug in Perl, reported as bug
number 56902
(L<http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=56902>). But
sending this routine a string which is pure ASCII doesn't make sense
anyway, so don't worry too much about it.

=head1 EXPORTS

This module exports L</subsjdate>, L</kanji2number>,
L</seireki_to_nengo>, L</nengo_to_seireki> and L</regjnums> on
request. All the functions can be exported using the tag C<:all> as in

    use Lingua::JA::FindDates ':all';

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 Other modules

=over

=item L<DateTime::Locale::JA>

Minimal selection of Japanese date functions. It's not complete enough
to deal with the full range of dates in actual documents.

=item L<DateTime::Format::Japanese>

This parses Japanese dates. Unlike the present module it claims to
also format them, so it can turn a L<DateTime> object into a Japanese
date, and it also does times. 

=item L<Lingua::JA::Numbers>

Kanji / numeral convertors. It converts numbers including decimal
points, and numbers into the billions and trillions.

=item L<DateTime::Calendar::Japanese::Era>

A full set of Japanese eras.

=item L<Lingua::JA::Moji>

Japanese character transliterations, including wide ascii numerals.
